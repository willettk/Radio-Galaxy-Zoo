            <p class="description">Black holes are found at the center of most, if not all, galaxies. The bigger the galaxy, the bigger the black hole and the more sensational the effect it can have on the host galaxy. These supermassive black holes drag in nearby material, growing to billions of times the mass of our sun and occasionally producing spectacular jets of material traveling nearly as fast as the speed of light. These jets often can't be detected in visible light, but are seen using radio telescopes. Astronomers need your help to find these jets and match them to the galaxy that hosts them.</p>

          <h2>Why do astronomers need your help?</h2>
          <p class="description">Black holes cannot be directly observed, since light cannot escape from them; but we can detect them by observing the effect they have on their surroundings. There are a number of methods for probing those surroundings, but for the supermassive black holes found at the center of galaxies, any optical or infrared light is obscured by large amounts of gas and dust. Fortunately, the jets of material spewed out by these supermassive black holes can be observed in the radio wavelengths.</p>
          <p class="description">There is a great deal of valuable information that can be obtained from the radio images of these jets, but we need to understand the host galaxy too. For instance, observing the host galaxy allows us to determine its distance, which is critical to understanding how big and how luminous the black hole actually is.</p>"""
    right: """
          <h2>What do astronomers hope to learn?</h2>
          <p class="description"> Astronomers have a good understanding of how small black holes (those that are several to tens of times more massive than our Sun) are formed. The picture is less clear for the supermassive black holes found in the center of galaxies. In order to better understand how these black holes form and evolve over time, astronomers need to observe many of them at different stages of their lifecycles. To do this, they need to find them first!</p>
          <p class="description">In order to better understand how supermassive black holes form, astronomers need more data to input into their models. Ideally, they need information about black holes at all stages of their lifecycle. To accomplish this, we want to identify as many black hole/jet pairs as possible and associate them with their host galaxies; with a large enough sample (from your classifications), we can pick out black holes at different stages and build a better picture of their origins.<a href="#/science">More ...</a></p>"""

WISE took images of the entire sky at four infrared wavelengths: 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 micrometers. The images in Radio Galaxy Zoo come from the 3.4 micrometer band; these means that the galaxies we're looking at emit their light as a combination of cool stars, warm dust that's been heated by starlight, and emission from a supermassive black hole. The 175,000 WISE images have been matched to FIRST data from the VLA, and cover most of the Northern and Southern Galactic Cap regions."""

It studies objects ranging from our own Solar System to the distant reaches of the Universe. In the early days of the <i>Spitzer</i> mission, the telescope was cryogenically cooled so that its three instruments (two cameras and a spectrograph) could observe the Universe at wavelengths from 3 to 180 micrometers. After its helium supply was exhausted in 2009, the telescope has continued to operate its IRAC camera in "Warm Mode", which it can do without the need for cryogenics."""

These were taken with the IRAC camera at a wavelength of 3.6 micrometers. The observed wavelength is similar to the WISE images, but have a higher resolution and sensitivity (in part because Spitzer's mirror is bigger than WISE's).

He coordinates the PULSE@Parkes project where students use the Parkes radio telescope to observe pulsars."

His background is in submillimetre astronomy so he's quite used to seeing the kind of 'fried eggs' that Radio Galaxy Zoo has to offer.
